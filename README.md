Project Overview
The project demonstrates an end-to-end Power BI analytics workflow, including:

Data preparation and cleaning for ticket, passenger, and flight datasets.

Data modeling: table relationships, cardinality, and optimized schemas.

Insightful calculations using DAX.

Several dynamic dashboards visualizing passenger counts, booking status, flight performance, and more.

Implementation of Row-Level Security (RLS) and scheduled refreshes.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and transform columns.

Data Modeling: Build relationships between entities (FlightID as key).

Insights & Calculations:

Flight classification (“Best” or “To Be Improved”).

DAX formulas for passenger counts and ticket analysis.

Custom calculated tables (e.g. only “Best” flights).

Visualizations & Interactivity:

Passenger count by airline.

Booking status distributions.

Flights segmented by airline and destination.

Slicers, drill-through, and airline-specific dashboard pages.

Security: Row-Level Security for restricted airline views.

Automated Refresh: Daily model refresh at 5PM IST.
